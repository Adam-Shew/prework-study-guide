# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This website was created to be used as a study guide for the UMN Coding Bootcamp. As the course continues, the page will be updated with information in order to continue being a resource throughout the remainder of the course. By creating this website, I was able to create a foundation of knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub and many other basic coding philosophies and processes.

## Usage

Each section of the study guide revolved around one of the topics discussed during our Prework period: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. As the semester continues, more information will be added to each topic. 

If you open up Chrome Inspector and navigate over to the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript in action. You will be promted with one of the topics discussed, and it can guide you on where to begin with your studies.
